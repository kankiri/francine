The francine project covers the development of an open source self-aware and intelligent android.

This artificial being has general intelligence and is able to understand its environment as well as its own presence within this environment.
Its actions are a combination of reflexes and planned interventions.
It can really comprehend basic words and understand sentences.
It expresses its inner feelings, describes events in nature and prompts people to do things.
It controls its actions both consciously and unconsciously.
It is developed following the example of the human brain's cognitive functionality.

The android is named Francine after Ren√© Descartes' daughter, Francine Descartes.
